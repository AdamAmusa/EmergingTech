  - Execute each cell in sequential order
  #### - /eliza
  - Open index.html in your preffered browser

## Installation
### 1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### 2. Install Jupyter Notebook
#### Using pip
    pip install notebook
#### Using Conda
    conda install -c conda-forge notebook
### 3. Installation for ./eliza 
   - Because index.html, eliza.js and style.css use languages that are native to browsers there is no need for additional installation.
    
## Usage
### Running The Trigram Notebook
 #### 1. **Open the notebook**
    jupyter notebook trigrams.ipynb
#### - Alternatively you can open it using Visual Studio code or any editor which supports python notebook
